## Description

This project has been developed by the contributors listed in the following section, as part of the **Software Architecture course at the University of Oviedo** for the academic year 2023/2024.

**WIQ** is a game inspired in the popular spanish show *"Saber y Ganar"*, where players must answer questions from different topics by choosing one of the options given to them. 

The questions in the game are generated automatically, keeping the game interesting and not repetitive. 

In addition you will be able to choose the topics you want to answer questions about from our topic list. Along with this we have several game modes related to the gameplay, such as answering as many questions as you can at a time
