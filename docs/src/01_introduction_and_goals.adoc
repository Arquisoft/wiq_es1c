== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

****
The functional requirements that the application will have:

* The system will have at least one web frontend that will be deployed and access will be through the Web.

* Users will be able to register in the system and consult the history of their participation in the system:
** Number of games
** Correct/Failed
** Questions
** Times

* The system will allow access to user information and questions generated through an API.

* The questions must be answered within a certain period of time.

* Each question will have one correct answer and several incorrect or distracting answers.

* Both the correct and incorrect answers will be generated automatically.

* The questions will be generated automatically from Wikidata data.

=== Quality Goals
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
|Quality goal
|Motivation
|Concrete Scenario
|Priority

|*Usability*
|Good User Experience(UX) will provide us any posibility to be competitive in the market
|We aim to achieve a beautiful, user-friendly graphical interface that is clear and easy to learn, in concrete, we look for 90% of the users to be able to use the application without any help
|High

|*Performance efficiency*
|Efficiency problems cause a very negative UX
|We aim to achieve a response time of less than 2 seconds for the new question to be displayed
|High

|*Maintainability*
|We hope that there will be changes to the project, or that the game modes will be expanded
|We will work on the optional parts regarding creating the mobile application and implementing various game modes
|Medium

=== Stakeholders
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
