== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Microservices architecture

We have decided that our architecture will be based on microservices, what means that every part of the
aplication will be divided in a service that performs a specific function. The service is reponsible for both
logic and database access and all the services are connected by an API.


=== User Experience

The application will consist of a website where the user will be able to play our asking game, however as we
have not started coding yet we do not have a clear idea of how it will look or if we are adding extra
functionality to the webpage.


=== Session handling

The application will include a system to control the user access to keep track of their games. This Information
will be saved in a database.


=== Persistence

The persistence module of this application is related to save user credentials and in addition register
the questions which are asked to the user and his answers. For this we will use a relational database.


=== Security & Safety

To ensure customer safety we will apply encryption to their passwords when saving registration or login data.

=== Testing

In order to avoid errors in our aplication we will include a bunch of tests that cover both the frontend
and backend areas.

=== Internationalization

At this point of the proyect we are not sure if we will implement Internationalization, it's a decision that
we will take as the proyect progresses.
