== Risks and Technical Debts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

=== 11.1 Technical risks

|Id|Scenario
| _Slow to display questions_ | _In case of having a large number of users using the application at the same time, our API can generate a bottleneck when generating requests to Wikidata._ | _Use a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes to replicate our API and thus balance the load of requests. Another possible solution would be to store the queries requested to Wikidata for later use without having to make the request at that instant._
| _Obsolescence of questions_ | _In case of storing the requested questions to Wikidata it is possible that some of them may become obsolete._ | _A separate microservice could be made whose purpose is to update the answers to the questions from time to time._

|Id|Scenario
| _Wikidata could limit the use of its API_ | _In case of having a large number of users using the application at the same time, Wikidata itself may limit the number of requests or even ban us from using it._ | _Store queries requested to Wikidata for later use without the need to make the request at the time._
