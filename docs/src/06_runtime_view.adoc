=== User plays a questions game
When the users starts a game, it does so via the game service (which internally will use the questions service). The game service will provide questions until the end of the game.

=== A new question is generated
Other services can ask the questions service to generate a question, this serves as an abstraction over the WikiData API as we are only interested in the questions and not the raw data.
